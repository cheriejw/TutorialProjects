# TutorialProjects
*A git repo of all the tutorial projects I have done along with a README summarizing my thoughts.*

This repository is mainly for myself to reference (in my attempt to progress), so there will be a lack of technical terminology as I am relatively new to all of these projects and topics.

### Table of Contents *(literally)*
| FileName | Description | Date |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| **CSSOAPAPI**  | Misnamed for now, just a **basic API in C# (.NET framework)** to warm up to it. | 11/08/2017
