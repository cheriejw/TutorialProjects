# [Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)
[Getting Started with Heroku Portal](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
### Procedure with Notes
 - Installed Heroku CLI(Toolbox)
 - `heroku login`
 - `git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git`
 - `cd node-js-getting-started`
 - `heroku create`
 - `git push heroku master`
    ```bash
    remote: Verifying deploy... done.
    To https://git.heroku.com/ancient-retreat-91601.git
    ```
 - `heroku ps:scale web=1`
    ```bash
    Scaling dynos... done, now running web at 1:Free
    ```
 - `heroku open` -- This failed so I had to open the launched url in browser.
 - `heroku logs --tail` -- Streams the logs... probably in a log file somewhere. Noticed a variable called 'dyno'.
 - Looking at [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#define-a-procfile), which explicitly declares what commands to execute to start app. Reminds me of the config file for TravisCI, travis.yml.
 - `heroku ps:scale web=0` -- The 'dyno' is compared to a lightweight container that runs the command in the Procfile. Web dynos serve requests. Can run `heroku ps` to see how many 'dynos' are running.
 - `npm install`
 - `heroku local web` -- changed to port 5005 because 5000 was not rendering oddly... `heroku local` uses the code I pushed to it.
