[Walkthrough: Creating a Windows Service Application in the Component Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-services/walkthrough-creating-a-windows-service-application-in-the-component-designer)

MyNewService.cs vs MyNewService.designer.cs

>A service application is designed to be long-running, so it usually polls or monitors something in the system. The monitoring is set up in the OnStart method. However, OnStart doesnâ€™t actually do the monitoring. The OnStart method must return to the operating system after the service's operation has begun. It must not loop forever or block.
